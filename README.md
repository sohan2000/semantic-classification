Discover the nuances of LSTM and BiLSTM with various data configurations in this study. We analyze models using preprocessed and raw data, with and without dropout layers, with sparse and dense vector representations offering insights into neural network behaviors.

The below are the results we got as we performed different configurations for our model.
